My undergraduate degree was in political science.  I find politics very interesting but have no desire to enter that arena.  I am too transparent with my emotions 
and am not quick enough on my feet.  So I will gladly watch from the outside and treat it for what it is a show but help where I can in the background.  To that end 
this code is developed to help a small town modernize its vote counting procedure.

The code will do the following-
-Count the total number of votes.
-Determine the total number of votes cast for each candidate and the percentage of the total ballots cast.
-From this info we can determine the winner of the election
