I am a geologist by training but I like finances and married a woman who was a finance 
major in college.  But she doesn't do any of our finances currently.  :)

For this assignment I get to play a finanical analyst and determine the following bits of info-
  
  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

This data is not just for me though, this is for the board and so I will export the results
to a text file.

Note- The number formats are not ideal.  I did try and add commas and round to two significant digits 
but that caused errors in the code.  I will continue to work on formatting as we progress.
